# Versions

## Major Version: 0
This phase is mostly full of poking things to see what works and getting used to using Hugo for site development. 

### 0.1.0 
Made a nice jump when I got a CMS plugged in. Using forestry.io, which is providing me a CMS and is automating my deployment process. I am a little obsessed with how easy forestry actually is to set up. I originally planned to put the CMS and automation process off as long as possible because I expected it to be the most complicated part. Since I am most unfamiliar with deployment and devops things, it is the part that normally causes the most issues.

I also used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) in Chrome Dev Tools to run an audit on my site and made several smaller updates to improve my scores.

### 0.0.2
In this version I was mostly focused on the blog section. I wanted to get a blog list and individual posts set up. This version was worked on mostly using vim, as I was trying to learn how to use it better, (and vs code keeps crashing on my chromebook (linux side)). 
 
### 0.0.1

Barely functional early draft. Site has basic mostly static pages. Some level of design has been implemented, and empty placeholder pages exist.
