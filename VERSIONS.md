# Michelle's Portfolio: 2018 Edition

## Major Version: 0
This phase is mostly full of poking things to see what works and getting used to using Hugo for site development. 

### 0.0.1

Barely functional early draft. Site has basic mostly static pages. Some level of design has been implemented, and empty placeholder pages exist.  

## (Future) Major Version: 1
Version 1 will be reached when I have all pages/content transfered over from old portfolio. 

**Pages:** Home, about, code (portfolio list), writing (blog list), teaching (speaking/workshop list), resources (list of tutorials/sites/tools I find helpful)

## (Future) Major Version 2
Main functionality required for version 2: automation of the deployment process. Continue building out pages and adding content.

## (Future) Major Version 3
Main functionality required for version 3: Get a CMS type system set up for adding content easily.
