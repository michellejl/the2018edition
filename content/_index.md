# Hi. My name is Michelle 

Welcome to version 0.0.2 of my 2018 portfolio.

## Thoughts
I've created way too many versions of my portfolio since I bought my first url in 2011, and none of them have lived more than maybe 8 months top. I've spent pretty much all of January thinking about what went wrong with all the past attempts. I spent time poking at different options before landing here. I spent a lot of January writing and then throwing out code as I tried out different things and decided they didn't work the way I wanted.

This is still a very early version, but hopefully one that I can expand on.

Currently this is built using Hugo and lots of manualness. I am finding that a lot of what I liked about Hugo (what made me pick it) is also causing me problems. 

Once I settled on using a static site generator, Hugo found it's way to the top spot mostly because it doesn't default to a blog setting like many of the other static site generators. Hugo gives more flexibility in how you want to build the site. That same flexibility that drew me to Hugo has been making development slower.

# Versions

## Major Version: 0
This phase is mostly full of poking things to see what works and getting used to using Hugo for site development. 

### 0.0.2
In this version I was mostly focused on the blog section. I wanted to get a blog list and individual posts set up. This version was worked on mostly using vim, as I was trying to learn how to use it better, (and vs code keeps crashing on my chromebook (linux side)). 
 
### 0.0.1

Barely functional early draft. Site has basic mostly static pages. Some level of design has been implemented, and empty placeholder pages exist.

________


## (Future) Major Version: 1
Version 1 will be reached when I have all pages/content transfered over from old portfolio. 

**Pages:** Home, about, code (portfolio list), writing (blog list), teaching (speaking/workshop list), resources (list of tutorials/sites/tools I find helpful)

## (Future) Major Version 2
Main functionality required for version 2: automation of the deployment process. Continue building out pages and adding content. This is also the version where I will start working on indieweb-ifying my site :)

## (Future) Major Version 3
Main functionality required for version 3: Get a CMS type system set up for adding content easily.
