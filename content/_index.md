# Hi. My name is Michelle

### Hello World!

Iâ€™m Michelle, a creative front end developer currently working as a contractor at Nike. Nothing excites me more than immersing myself in a good challenge or a great book. For me, coding is the perfect mix of logical problem solving, and creative artistic expression. When not coding, I am spending my time creating something new, getting involved in the local tech community, or exploring the world around me with my trusty Nikon camera.
