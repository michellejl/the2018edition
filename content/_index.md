# Hi. My name is Michelle

### Hello World!

Iâ€™m Michelle, a creative front end developer currently working as a contractor at Nike. Nothing excites me more than immersing myself in a good challenge or a great book. For me, coding is the perfect mix of logical problem solving, and creative artistic expression. When not coding, I am spending my time creating something new, getting involved in the local tech community, or exploring the world around me with my trusty Nikon camera.

### Community Involvement

I started attending meetups and meeting my coding community in Portland during the summer of 2015. I now volunteer with and organize meetups for PDXNode and Women Who Code Portland. I have spent time volunteering at other various meetups and always make sure to help out a new developer where I can.

<p class="p-fancy"><strong>PDXNode</strong> - I joined the organizing team for this meetup in the first half of 2017. I help with organizing our two regular monthly events: a presentation night and a hack night. I also help out with community engagement via twitter, and have been reaching out to gather sponsors.</p>

<p class="p-fancy"><strong>Women Who Code Portland</strong> - I was brought on to the leadership team towards the end of 2016 officially. I spent the first several months helping at Networking Nights, and filling in as needed for other events. In 2018 I am stepping into a more regular role as the co-lead for the Open Source Study Nights that are held once a month. I will also be creating a set of four CSS based workshops that I will lead this year. </p>

<p class="p-fancy"<strong>West Beaverton Toastmasters</strong> - I joined Toastmasters in February of 2018. Starting on July 1, 2018 I took over as VP of Education for the West Beaverton club.
