Went to a Coder Bytes meetup in July 2017. The challenge for the week was to create a Pig Latin translator in a language of choice. Since I normally work in JavaScript, I decided to try Python to force myself out of my comfort zone a little bit. 

The rules given for the challenge were:

1. If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel, put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add "ay."  Example: Happy = appyh + ay = appyhay
2. If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay." Example: Child = Ildch + ay = Ildchay
3. If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word. Example: Awesome = Awesome +way = Awesomeway
