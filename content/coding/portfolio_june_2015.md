This static site was my first portfolio site since starting at code school. I used [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) for my base styles, while using [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) as an animation library. I picked bits and pieces from various tutorials to create different effects that I wanted. All the photography and graphics are my own creation.

This is also the first version of my portfolio I created after being introduced to git/github.

This version was eventually replaced with a version that allows for easier updates. This was a fun static site to build and one of my first sites that uses external libraries.

(note: many of the links on the live version are no longer working and this site has not been updated since 2015.)
