Little project that reads an API to get a randomly selected quote. There is a button for getting a new quote, or tweeting the current one. I also had some fun with creating a random color generator, so you can use the bottom two buttons to change the foreground and background colors.

The basis of this project comes from a challenge prompt on Free Code Camp. [Details here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine).
