A simple HTML/CSS static site built in response to one of the FreeCodeCamp Front End challenges. The challenge rules can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page). I picked my all time favorite band, Queen, to create this page. Super basic project. Gave me a chance to start playing around with bootstrap.
