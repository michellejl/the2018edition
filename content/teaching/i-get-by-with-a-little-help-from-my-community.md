This meetup([PDXFLIT: Developer Engagement Starter Pack](https://www.meetup.com/pdxFLIT-Portland-Future-Leaders-In-Tech/events/251940966/)) was one of my scariest speaking experiences so far. Just before the first speaker started, I went to pull up my slides only to find they were totally deleted! With less than 15 minutes to go, I quickly improvised. I think I still pulled it off pretty well!

I even got to really meet one of the inspiring people I mentioned in my talk. He was actually the third speaker, which I did not know when I originally wrote the talk.
