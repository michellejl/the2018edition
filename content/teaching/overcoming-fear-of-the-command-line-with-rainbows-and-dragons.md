During the Write/Speak/Code conference I attended in the summer of 2017, I wrote a lightning talk. Below I have the updated slides, as well as a video recording from when I gave it at the PDXNode Meetup in November of 2017. 

I also wrote a companion [blog article](http://www.michellejl.com/writing/2017-08-28-command-line-lightning-talk/) with some of the more technical details I was unable to include in a 10 minute talk.
